Hi! I am Joe, an undergraduate of CS in SJTU. I'm a curious person with a wide range of interests. Professionally, I'm fascinated by fields like VLM, robotics, and computer graphics. In my personal time, I enjoy creative and active pursuits, like origami, various sports and playing the violin.

I use this blog to occasionally share learning notes and bits of my life. I can be a bit introverted and am still working on my communication skills, but I'm always open to making new friends.
